# RAPID
 Ring test Analysis Program for optIcal fiber bunDles (RAPID)
 
 # Motivation
 Ring test analysis is an essential way of checking efficiency and quality of optical fibers but the process can be very time consuming. By RAPID graphical user interface, you can analyze and visualize the output ring images of the fiber by only inputting the output image of the test.
 
 
# An example of the graphical user interface:
